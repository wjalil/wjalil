🧠⚡️ Wahid Jalil — 

I’m building whatever makes life easier, businesses smarter, and ideas real.

👨‍🍳 I’ve gone from architecting financial analytics to architecting catering logistics (and yes, the cookies were 🔥).
💸 From wrangling hedge fund dashboards to launching crypto TRS engines in my spare time.
📬 From Jira queues to auto-emailing rebooking reminders for lash appointments.

I love making tools that:

Automate the boring stuff

Bring real-world impact (not just code for code's sake)

Mix finance, data, and a touch of hustle

💼 Real estate funds the runway. Curiosity fuels the projects.
🏗️ Always building. Often overengineering. Never not learning.

This GitHub is my sandbox—feel free to poke around, fork something, or just say hi.
